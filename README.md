========================

* [X] Make sure users can register and login

* [-] Create a twitter-type. This should be able to add <div class="input-prepend"><span class="add-on">@</span> in the form (already present in moopa)
* [ ] Matchenvironment widget should check matches based on environments (how do we calculate this?)
* [ ] Can we easily add fancyboxes for add/edit ?

* [ ] Add links that allow users to add hardware/software/OS
* [ ] View more in the top-widgets should point to a TOP-X page (paginated) page.
* [ ] Make sure that machine / environment matches up (ie: /box/machine/X/environment/Y)
* [ ] add a "add environment" thumbnail in the thumbnail view (also for machines)
* [ ] Notification bars are not completely lined up with the "well"
* [ ] registration.flash.user_created should be translated
* [ ] first/second in registration should be translated
* [X] twitter handle should be added
* [X] when adding email address to registration, it should automatically load gravatar image
