<p>You are about to add your first environment to your machine. This environment is the main operating system of your
machine. If you have multiple OS'es, don't worry, you can add more afterwards. Also, don't worry about any ordering.
Just because it's the first OS, doesn't make it special</p>

<h1>Add another environment to {{ machine }}</h1>
<p>If you have more than one operating systems running on your system, here is your change to add them as well. It is
also possible that you have virtual machines running in your system. This is also the place to add them. Make sure you
check the 'virtualized' checkbox to let us know it's a virtualized environment!</p>
