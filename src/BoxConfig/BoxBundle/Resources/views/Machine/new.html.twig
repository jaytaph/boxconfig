    <h1>It looks like it's the first time you add a machine!</h1>
    <p>Awesome. You are about to enter a machine. This can be a laptop, your home computer, maybe even your servers! At
    this point you don't need to worry about all the operating systems and software running on it. We take care of that
    later. Just select the hardware type (or add a new hardware profile if it doesn't exist yet!), and enter the name,
    description and anything else you like here. Did you know that most developers use female names for their computers?
    Also planets and mythylogical figure are high on the names list. You wouldn't be the first one that named their
    machine Zeus :) </p>
{% elseif app.user.machines | length == 1 %}
    <h1>All right! Time for your second machine!</h1>
    <p>Now we can enter a second machine, and maybe even a third or fourth? A quick tip: if you don't use a machine
    anymore, you can mark it as inactive. However, I think you already grasp the basics of adding a machine, so here
    you go!</p>
{% elseif app.user.machines | length >= 2 %}
    <h1>Add another machine</h1>
    <p>You probably know the drill by now. No need to tell you about adding new machines!</p>
